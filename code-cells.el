;;; Commentary:

;; With this package, you can efficiently navigate, edit and execute
;; code split into cells according to certain magic comments.  It also
;; allows to open ipynb notebook files directly in Emacs.  They will
;; be automatically converted to a script for editing, and converted
;; back to notebook format when saving.  An external tool, Jupytext by
;; default, is required for this.
;;
;; A minor mode, `code-cells-mode`, provides the following features:
;;
;; - Fontification of cell boundaries.
;;
;; - Keybindings for the cell navigation and evaluation commands,
;;   under the `C-c %' prefix.
;;
;; - Outline mode integration: cell headers have outline level
;;   determined by the number of percent signs or asterisks; within a
;;   cell, outline headings are as determined by the major mode, but
;;   they are demoted by an amount corresponding to the level of the
;;   containing cell.  This provides code folding and hierarchical
;;   navigation, among other things, when `outline-minor-mode` is
;;   active.
;;
;; This minor mode is automatically activated when opening an ipynb
;; file, but you can also activate it in any other buffer, either
;; manually or through some hook.
